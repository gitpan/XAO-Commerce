Setting up data structures:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) First, run configure.pl, which will prompt you for some respones.
A typical set of responses to the prompts could be as follows:

 PROJECT=commerce
 ODB_DSN=OS:MySQL_DBI:commerce
 ODB_USER=commerce
 ODB_PASSWORD=abc123

Note that the values here are consistent with the example given
in the Commerce.pm docs for setting up XAO::FS with the
script `xao-fs' (see README for XAO-Commerce).

Running configure.pl will set up the following files from their
*.proto counterparts:
  - objects/Config.pm
  - bin/add-admin
  - bin/build-structure
  - bin/ifilter-flatfile
  - bin/import-map
  - bin/mark-empty-categories
  - bin/scan-flatfile

2) To set up the Foundation Server data structure objects/Config.pm
for this sample site run bin/build-structure.

3) To load data from sample flatfile follow the steps:

  - Convert flatfile to RawXML file conversion by executing:

    % bin/scan-flatfile sample_products.txt > sample_products.xml

  - Upload RawXML data to XAO::FS project by executing:

    % bin/ifilter-flatfile sample_products.xml

  - Perform end-level data processing by executing:

    % bin/import-map FlatFile

  - You may check data content using the SQL query from 'select.sql'
    to get loaded data directly from database to tab delimited file
    'out_selected.txt'.
